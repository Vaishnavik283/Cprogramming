TITLE

Write a simple C program to print "Hello world" on screen and understand the complete development process.



THEORY
Compiling program is the process of converting high level programming language into low level programming language that can be executed by computer's central processing unit. To turn a C program into an executable file, a series of steps that involve writing, compiling, and linking the code.

LAB 2 A



Title

Write a C program to print size of different data types.

Theory

The sizeof operator in C is used to determine the size, in bytes, of a data type or a variable. The syntax for using the sizeof operator is as follows: sizeof (type); The %lu or %zu format specifier used for sizeof operator.

LAB 2B
Title
Write a C program to read a number from user and print a table of multiplication for that number.

Aim
To print a table of a number.

Explanation
By using for loop, table of multiplication for any number will be execute.

LAB 2C :

Title
Write a program to display different star patterns on screen.

Aim
To print star pattern.

Explanation
In this programme, the user wants to make a pattern by entering the number of rows and columns. The programme creates a pattern of stars with two halves: one with ascending rows and the other with descending rows, separated by a newline character. The number of stars in each row is determined by the value of "i" within the respective loops by using nested for loops.

LAB 3 A
Title
Write a program to demonstrate pointers. Declare a pointer ptr to interger and equate it to address of integer i. Print value of i, value of &i, value of ptr and value of *ptr.

Theory
A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. It "points" to the location in memory where data is stored. int *ptr; declares a pointer ptr that can point to an integer.

Explanation
This program explain how pointers can be used to access memory addresses and the values stored at those addresses
